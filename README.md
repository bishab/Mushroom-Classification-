# Mushroom Classification
Hey! 

From the title you must have been aware of what thing this chunk of code contains. Well, all spells are not that tough tho (just remember avrakadevra!ðŸ˜œ)

## Resources
The resource includes just a csv file which i downloaded from Kaggle

The things are quite interesting and I have tried to keep codes as less as I could cause we all love less spells, don't we?


<b> P.S. ExtraTreesClassifier did not disappoint me for giving output of 100%!!!! Check this out!
